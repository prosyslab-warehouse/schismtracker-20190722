Lower 12 bits of the CWTV field in IT and S3M files.

"Proper" version numbers went the way of the dodo, but we can't really fit an eight-digit date stamp directly
into a twelve-bit number. Since anything < 0x50 already carries meaning (even though most of them weren't
used), we have 0xfff - 0x50 = 4015 possible values. By encoding the date as an offset from a rather arbitrarily
chosen epoch, there can be plenty of room for the foreseeable future.

  < 0x020: a proper version (files saved by such versions are likely very rare)
  = 0x020: any version between the 0.2a release (2005-04-29?) and 2007-04-17
  = 0x050: anywhere from 2007-04-17 to 2009-10-31 (version was updated to 0x050 in hg changeset 2f6bd40c0b79)
  > 0x050: the number of days since 2009-10-31, for example:
	0x051 = (0x051 - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2009-11-01
	0x052 = (0x052 - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2009-11-02
	0x14f = (0x14f - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2010-07-13
	0xffe = (0xfff - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2020-10-27
  = 0xfff: a non-value indicating a date after 2020-10-27 (assuming Schism Tracker still exists then) */

Information at our disposal:

	VERSION
		"" or "YYYYMMDD"
		A date here is the date of the last commit from git
		empty string will happen if git isn't installed, or no .git

	__DATE__        "Jun  3 2009"
	__TIME__        "23:39:19"
	__TIMESTAMP__   "Wed Jun  3 23:39:19 2009"
		These are annoying to manipulate beacuse of the month being in text format -- but at
		least I don't think they're ever localized, which would make it much more annoying.
		Should always exist, especially considering that we require gcc. However, it is a
		poor indicator of the age of the *code*, since it depends on the clock of the computer
		that's building the code, and also there is the possibility that someone was hanging
		onto the code for a really long time before building it.
