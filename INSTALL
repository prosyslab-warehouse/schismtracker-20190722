This is a fairly typical autotools package. In a nutshell, if you're using
a roughly Unix-ish environment:

    0.) autoreconf -i
        You only need this if you've fetched this package from the repo
        and lack ./configure in the top-level source directory.

    1.) ./configure
        Want plenty more options than you need? ./configure --help

    2.) make
        This should create a ./schismtracker binary, which you can
        move around to wherever it makes you happiest.

    3.) make install
        If you want it installed! You likely want sudo for this.

    4.) happy tracking!
